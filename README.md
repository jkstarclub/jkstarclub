## System Requirements ⚡

CMake 3.17: https://cmake.org/download/
MSVC v142: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/

```

feat. micro refinements

In a few days, you will be able to:

 - package content
 - build process
 - refine components
 - do asset management
 - let style control

If there is a track, curve the turn like so: 

Revolve: #123

# Scale Invariant Feature Transform

the scale space of images and extract the local extrema with Difference of Gaussian function

# Speeded Up RobuFeatures

the eterminant of Hessian blob detector / Euclidean distance

# Histogram of Oriented Gradients

feature extraction in local region by tracking orientation histograms of edge intensity

# Hough Transform

feature extraction technique

# Random Sample Consensus

an iterative method to estimate parameters of a mathematical model from a set of observed data that contains outliers / the goal is to determine the points in the space that project onto an image into a set of landmarks with known locations

# Kalman Filter Family

MEKF 'Car Park Dataset' 'Victoria Park Dataset' non linear SLAM.
EKF The predicted observation value at time k is formulated like so where h is Jacobian matrix . R is the covariance of V.
UKF a set of weighted sigma points are used to represent the stochastic characteristics of the state vector.
IKF Iterated Kalman Filter
